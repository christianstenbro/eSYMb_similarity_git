        Welcome to the similarity rating experiment!
      </p><p>
        In this experiment you will be presented with images containing two different line patterns. Your task is to rate how similar you find the two patterns in each image.
        <br>
      </p><p>
        The ratings are made on a scale from 0-100, with 0 indicating complete difference and 100 indicating that the patterns are indentical.
        After rating each pair using a slider, you can press the <strong>Next</strong> button to proceed to the next trial.
        <br> <!-- could also have examples in the instruction page to make it more clear -->
      </p><p>
        The experiment contains around 'n' image pairs, and your rating task is divided into three sets. Between the sets you will be invited to take longer breaks.
        You do not need to spend a lot of time on each rating, but please consider the patterns in detail before you rate.
        <br>
      </p><p>
        Before beginning the experiment, you will be shown different examples of the types of pattern pairs you will be rating. 
        Click <strong>Next</strong> to continue to the example page.
