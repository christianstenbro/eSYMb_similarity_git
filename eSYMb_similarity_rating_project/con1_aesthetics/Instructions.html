	  <p>Welcome to this part of the experiment.</p>

	  <p>In this game, you will play individually.</p>

	  <p>There are 8 rounds. In each round, you will see a set of patterns and a rock surface.
		First, you choose which pattern you want to use to decorate the rock surface.
		Then, you draw the chosen pattern on the surface using the drawing tool.
		When you are happy with your drawing, click SEND to proceed.<p/>

	  <p>There is no time limit, but we expect each drawing will take around 1 minute (it doesn't have to be perfect).</p>

	  <p>Remember:<p/>
		<ul>
		  <li>Your drawing must match the chosen pattern, otherwise it may be rejected, and you will need to redraw it.</li>
		  <li>To draw a line, click and drag your mous.</li>
		  <li>To move a line, click on its center and drag it to the desired position.</li>
		  <li>To rotate a line, click on one of the ends and drag it to the desired position.</li>
		  <li>To delete a line, double-click on it.</li>
		</ul>
