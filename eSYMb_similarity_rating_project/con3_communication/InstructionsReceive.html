	  <p>In this game, two people will play together as a group. <br />
		Another player will be the SENDER and you will be the RECEIVER.  <br />
		The overall goal of the game is that the RECEIVER correctly identifies the concepts that the SENDER is trying to communicate. </p>

	  <p>Throughout the game, the SENDER and you (the RECEIVER) will see the same set of 4 concepts represented by the following images:  </p>

	  <div id="pattern" style="margin: 20px auto;">
		{{ for concept in C.CONCEPT_OPTIONS }}
		<img src="{{ concept }}" width="{{C.IMG_DIM}}px" height="{{C.IMG_DIM}}px">
		{{ endfor }}
	  </div>

	  <p>The SENDER will also see a set of 4 patterns (each pattern is composed of 6 black lines), but you will not see these patterns. <br />
			There are 8 rounds. In each round, the SENDER will try to communicate one of the concepts to you by choosing and drawing one of the patterns. <br />
			Your objective is to guess which concept the SENDER is trying to communicate. <br />
			After you have received each concept once (rounds 1-4), you will have the chance to receive them again (rounds 5-8). </p>
