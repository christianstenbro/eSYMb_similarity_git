	  <p>Welcome!</p>

	  <p>In this game, two people will play together as a group. <br />
		You will be the SENDER and another player will be the RECEIVER. <br />
		The overall goal of the game is that the RECEIVER correctly identifies the concepts that the SENDER is trying to communicate. </p>

	  <p>Throughout the game, you (the SENDER) and the RECEIVER will see the same set of 4 concepts represented by the following images: </p>

	  <div id="pattern" style="margin: 20px auto;">
		{{ for concept in C.CONCEPT_OPTIONS }}
		<img src="{{ concept }}" width="{{C.IMG_DIM}}px" height="{{C.IMG_DIM}}px">
		{{ endfor }}
	  </div>

	  <p>Only you (the SENDER) will also see a set of 4 patterns (each pattern is composed of 6 black lines). <br />
		There are 8 rounds. In each round, one of the concepts will be pre-selected. Your task is to communicate the selected concept to the RECEIVER using one of the patterns. <br />
		To do that, first choose which pattern you want to use to communicate the concept, and then draw it on the rock surface using the drawing tool. <br />
		Your drawing will then be sent to the RECEIVER, who will guess which concept you are trying to communicate. <br />
		After you have communicated each concept once (rounds 1-4), you will have the chance to communicate them again (rounds 5-8). </p>

	  <p>Your objective is to help the RECEIVER identify the concepts you are trying to communicate with your drawings. </p>

	  <p>Remember:
		<ul>
		  <li>Your drawing must match the chosen pattern, otherwise it may be rejected, and you will need to redraw it.</li>
		  <li>To draw a line, click and drag your mouse.</li>
		  <li>To move a line, click on its center and drag it to the desired position.</li>
		  <li>To rotate a line, click on one of the ends and drag it to the desired position.</li>
		  <li>To delete a line, double-click on it.</li>
		</ul>
