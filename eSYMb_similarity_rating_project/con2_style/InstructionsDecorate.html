	  <p>Welcome to this part of the experiment.</p>

	  <p>In this game, four people will play together split in two groups. </p>
	  <p>In your group, you will be the DRAWER and another player will be the GUESSER. </p>
	  <p>In the other group there will also be one DRAWER and one GUESSER. </p>
	  <p>The overall goal of the game is that the GUESSERS correctly identify the drawings made by the DRAWER from their own group.  </p>

	  <p>There are 8 rounds. In each round, you (the DRAWER) will see
	  4 patterns (each pattern consists of 6 black lines). One pattern
	  will be pre-selected. You will be asked to draw the selected
	  pattern on the rock surface. <br />
		The DRAWER from the other group will also make a drawing, but you will not be able to see it. <br />
		Then, the two drawings – one made by you and the other made by the other DRAWER – will be shown to the GUESSERS. Their task will be to guess which drawing was made by the DRAWER from their own group. <br />
		At the end of each round, you will learn if the guesses were correct or wrong. <p/>

			<p>Your objective is to help the GUESSER from your group identify your drawings. </p>
