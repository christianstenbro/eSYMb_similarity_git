	  <p>Welcome!</p>

	  <p>In this game, four people will play together split in two groups.  <br />
		In your group, another player will be the DRAWER and YOU will be the GUESSER. <br />
		In the other group there will also be one DRAWER and one GUESSER. <br />
		The overall goal of the game is that the GUESSERS correctly identify the drawings made by the DRAWER from their own group. </p>

	  <p>There are 8 rounds. In each round, the two DRAWERS will each make a drawing. Once they are finished, you (the GUESSER) will be shown the two drawings, and you will be asked to guess which drawing was made by the DRAWER from your group. <br />
		At the end of each round, you will learn if your guess was correct or wrong. </p>

	  <p>Your objective is to identify the drawings made by the DRAWER from your group. </p>
