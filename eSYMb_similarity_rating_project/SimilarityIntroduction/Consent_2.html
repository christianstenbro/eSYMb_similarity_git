        The overall aim of this project is to advance our understanding of human cognition and behaviour between 100,000 – 50,000 years ago. 
        More specifically, in this study we are interested in examining the perceptual and cognitive properties of a set of drawings that were produced by participants in previous experiments. 
        This will eventually help us understand concrete collections of archaeological findings, and how they evolved in response to different social and cognitive factors.
