          <strong>Study procedure:</strong> 
          In this experiment, you will be asked to examine pairs of simple line drawings and rate how similar you find them. 
          The experiment includes a number of short trials divided into 3 blocks, and it should take about 30 min to complete. 
          There will be breaks between the blocks. At the start of the experiment, you will receive further instructions and do a practice round to familiarise yourself with the task and the rating scale.
