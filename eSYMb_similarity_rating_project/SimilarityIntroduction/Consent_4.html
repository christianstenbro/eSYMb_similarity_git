          The main data consist in your responses (similarity ratings), which will be included in subsequent statistical analyses. 
          We also collect simple demographic information such as age, declared gender, native language(s), and nationality. 
          Personal information used for payment is handled by Prolific and is not collected.

        <p>
          All the collected data are pseudonymised using your Prolific ID, and it will not be possible to directly identify participants based on the collected data.

          <strong>Open science:</strong> 
          In the interest of open science, the anonymized and preprocessed data will be made available to researchers from other institutions via public data repositories (usually OSF.org). 
          It will not be possible to identify you from any published data.
