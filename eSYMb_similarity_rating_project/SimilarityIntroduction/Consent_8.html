          Participation is voluntary and you may withdraw your consent at any time without stating a reason.  
          If you wish to withdraw consent after starting the experiment, simply leave the experiment without completing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the data are anonymised, it should be noted that you can withdraw consent up until you leave the experiment. 
          Consent cannot be withdrawn thereafter, since links between your id and data will no longer be identifiable.
