          In each trial, you will see two drawings displayed side-by-side. Here is one example: 
        </p>
        <div id="draw" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <label>
             <img id="imagePair" src="{{ static 'similarity/instruction_images/two_drawings.png' }}" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          </label>
        </div> 
        <p>
          These drawings come from previous experiments in which participants were asked to reproduce drawings from memory. 
          One drawing is the original, and the other is a copy made from memory. 
          The two drawings will always share some similarities, but the degree of similarity will vary from trial to trial. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <u><strong>YOUR TASK</strong> is to rate how similar you find the two drawings, using a 5-point scale that ranges from VERY LOW to VERY HIGH.</u>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A VERY HIGH rating means that the drawings look almost identical.</li>
          <li>A VERY LOW rating means that there are noticeable differences between them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please try to use the scale consistently throughout the experiment. 
          That is, drawing pairs that seem equally similar should receive approximately the same rating. 
          Don’t overthink it—just go with your first impression or gut feeling.
