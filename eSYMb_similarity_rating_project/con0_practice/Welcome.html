<p>Thank you for taking part in our research study ‘A drawing game using stone age images.’</p>

<p>The session is divided in three parts, and there will be a break of 0-30 minutes between them.</p>

<p>Before we begin the actual experiment, we will first guide you through a practice round to familiarize you with the interface. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter before moving forward to the actual experiment.</p>
