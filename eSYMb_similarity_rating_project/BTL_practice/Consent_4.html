          In this experiment, you will be asked to draw lines on a blank, digital canvas. 
          The number of lines you will be asked to draw will increase incrementally from 1 to 6 over the experimental trials. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The drawing tool is designed in a way where you are free to decide the relative position and orientation of lines while it allows you to only draw straight lines of a particular length and thickness. 
          Before the task begins, you will have time to familiarise yourself with the drawing tool. 
        </p>
        <p>
          More detailed instructions will be provided when the experiment begins.
