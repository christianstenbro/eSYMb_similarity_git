# eSYMb_similarity_git
 GitHub repository for the eSYMb Similarity Rating Experiment

Use 'cd eSYMb_similarity_rating_project' to navigate to the project folder. From here, you can use 'otree devserver' to test the experiment.

Currently, the image files are not included in the repository (to make commits more swift). I have uploaded these to the OneDrive in a folder called 'images', which should be placed inside 'eSYMb_similarity_rating_project/_static/similarity/'.
