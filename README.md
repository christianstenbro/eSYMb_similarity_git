# eSYMb_similarity_git
 GitHub repository for the eSYMb Similarity Rating Experiment

Currently, the image files are not included in the repository (to make commits more swift). 

I have uploaded a single folder to the OneDrive containing all drawings from study 1, 2 and 3 (called 'all_drawings')
This folder should be placed inside the '/_static/similarity/images' folder.

To test the project: 

Navigate to the project folder:

    `cd eSYMb_similarity_rating_project`

Set up a new virtual environment inside this folder:

    in the terminal you could use: `python -m venv name_of_virtual_environment´

    then activate the environment: `source name_of_virtual_environment/bin/activate´

Once the environment is activated, install the packages in the requirements.txt:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt´

Test-run the project using:

    `otree devserver´
