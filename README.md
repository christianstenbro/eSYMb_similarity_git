# eSYMb_similarity_git
 GitHub repository for the eSYMb Similarity Rating Experiment

Currently, the image files are not included in the repository (to make commits more swift). In the new version, the image files from study 1 and study 3 should be placed inside the '/_static/similarity/images' folder, in two seperate folders named 'study_1' and 'study_3', respectively.

To test the project: 

Navigate to the project folder:

    `cd eSYMb_similarity_rating_project`

Set up a new virtual environment inside this folder:

    in the terminal you could use: `python -m venv name_of_virtual_environment´

    then activate the environment: `source name_of_virtual_environment/bin/activate´

Once the environment is activated, install the packages in the requirements.txt:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt´

Test-run the project using:

    `otree devserver´
